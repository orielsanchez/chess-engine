## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Core data type tests
- [ ] Move generation tests
- [ ] Position evaluation tests
- [ ] Search algorithm tests
- [ ] FEN parsing tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full game simulation
- [ ] UCI protocol compliance
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Position database tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Move generation speed
- [ ] Search depth benchmarks
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Endgame solving tests

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Structures
- Board representation: Start with 8x8 array, migrate to bitboards
- Move representation: 16-bit compact encoding
- Search: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluation: Incremental material + piece-square tables

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- Standard library focus
- Optional: rayon for parallelization
- Optional: clap for CLI parsing

## Definition of Done

### Feature Completion Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Code passes clippy lints
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Memory usage within limits

### Release Criteria
- Playing strength > 1500 ELO
- UCI protocol fully implemented
- Sub-second move generation
- Stable under extended play
- Clean codebase with no technical debt
