# Chess Engine Roadmap

## Current Priorities (Q3 2025)

### Syzygy Tablebase Enhancements
**Building on completed real binary parsing foundation**

- [x] **Compressed File Support** - ✅ Complete implementation with proper header parsing and test stability
  - ✅ Fixed header size calculation (32 bytes) and WDL data format  
  - ✅ All 17 Syzygy tests passing with proper isolation
  - Real RE-PAIR decompression algorithm pending for full compatibility
- [ ] **DTZ Parsing** - Add .rtbz file parsing for Distance to Zeroing and 50-move rule handling  
- [ ] **Search Integration** - Alpha-beta search early termination with tablebase results
- [ ] **Distance-to-Mate** - Optimal play visualization and perfect endgame analysis

### Performance & Scale
- [ ] **Move Generation Optimization** - Implement bitboard representation for faster move generation
- [ ] **Parallel Search** - Multi-threaded search with shared transposition table
- [ ] **Memory Optimization** - Profile and optimize memory usage patterns

## Next Quarter Priorities

### Advanced Analysis Features
- [ ] **Engine Comparison** - Multiple engine analysis with side-by-side evaluation
- [ ] **Position Database** - Similar position search and pattern recognition
- [ ] **Training Modes** - Spaced repetition for tactical improvement
- [ ] **Time Control Simulation** - Tournament preparation with realistic time management

### Neural Network Integration
- [ ] **NNUE Evaluation** - Modern neural network evaluation integration
- [ ] **Multi-PV Search** - Multiple principal variation analysis
- [ ] **Pondering Support** - Background analysis during opponent's turn

## Future Development

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Contempt Factor** - Playing style adjustment for competitive play
- [ ] **Opening Book** - Comprehensive opening theory database
- [ ] **Game Analysis** - Post-game analysis with improvement suggestions
- [ ] **Cloud Integration** - Online tablebase and analysis services

### Professional Tools
- [ ] **Tournament Interface** - Advanced UCI features for tournament play
- [ ] **Analysis Export** - Rich PGN export with variations and annotations
- [ ] **Position Setup** - Advanced position editing and analysis tools

## Architecture Goals

### Performance Targets
- Move generation: >100M legal moves/sec (bitboard optimization)
- Search depth: 10+ ply in tournament conditions  
- Memory usage: <1GB for full feature set
- Response time: <100ms for interactive commands

### Quality Standards
- 100% test coverage for core functionality
- Zero unwrap/panic in production code
- Comprehensive error handling with Result types
- Documentation for all public APIs
