## In Progress

### Currently Working On
- Implement basic move validation

## Done

### Completed Features
- Project initialization
- Basic Rust project structure
- Development guidelines established
- Define core data types (Square, Piece, Color, PieceType)
- Implement basic board representation (8x8 array)
- Create position structure with game state
- Complete attack detection system
- Starting position setup and display
- Add FEN parsing and generation
- FEN roundtrip conversion with validation
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid FEN

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Core data type tests
- [ ] Move generation tests
- [ ] Position evaluation tests
- [ ] Search algorithm tests
- [ ] FEN parsing tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full game simulation
- [ ] UCI protocol compliance
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Position database tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Move generation speed

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Structures
- Board representation: Start with 8x8 array, migrate to bitboards
- Move representation: 16-bit compact encoding
- Search: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluation: Incremental material + piece-square tables

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- Standard library focus
- Optional: rayon for parallelization
- Optional: clap for CLI parsing

- Memory usage within limits

### Release Criteria
- Playing strength > 1500 ELO
